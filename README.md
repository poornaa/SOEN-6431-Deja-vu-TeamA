4. System 4- Hotel Management
The Hotel Management Application is a project created to provide users with a platform to manage and book hotel rooms. This application functions through the console, which offers a simple and straightforward way to interact with the system. Users can search for available rooms, make reservations, and view their booking details. 
Being a project made by first year university students, this project lacked functionality as it was able to provide complex features like inventory management and integration with external systems was missing. Being a console-based system through and through it cannot be considered visually appealing to the client due to its lack of user-based inputs and relying heavily on text-based inputs which might be unintuitive for non-technical users. So, more than being a high-level functioning system, this system seems more like a programming exercise given to students to get a greater understanding of object-oriented programming and its various elements like inheritance, abstraction etc.
